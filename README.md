# Objective of the database: 
The objective of our system is to manage an e-commerce store's sales data, order history, and customer transactions, based on the dataset we found. The system will allow the admin to monitor product performance, manage stock levels, and review sales history. Customers will be able to review products theyâ€™ve purchased, and data-driven insights will be provided to optimize inventory management and sales strategies. Additionally, the system will include tools for forecasting product demand, ensuring better stock availability, and analyzing customer purchasing patterns.
